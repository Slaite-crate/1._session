## 1. Start by creating a directory (folder) where all the exercise files will be placed.
##You decide where, but a good place would be on your desktop, or in your document directory.

    mkdir "a new folder"
    cd "a new folder"


## 2. Create a file with the name to_be_deleted.txt

    touch to_be_deleted.txt


## 3. delete the file to_be_deleted.txt

    rm to_be_deleted.txt


## 4. Move the 3 exercise files into this directory.

    cd ..
    mv ex1.acc ex1.dat orphans.sp "a new folder"


## 5. Use a text editor (VS Code is good choise) to create a file called mycommands.txt
##where you write all commands and observations you do in the following exercises.
##Use copy/paste to copy the commands. from the terminal to your text file.

....


## 6. First list the files in the directory.

    cd "a new folder"
    ls


## 7. Copy ex1.acc to myfile.acc.

    cp ex1.acc myfile.acc


## 8. Look at the content of both files to ensure they are identical.

....


## 9. Copy ex1.dat to myfile.acc.

    cp ex1.dat myfile.acc


## 10. Check that the content of myfile.acc changed.

....


## 11. Delete myfile.acc.

    rm myfile.acc


## 12. Make a directory test and move the three files to it.

    mkdir test
    mv ex1.acc ex1.dat orphans.sp test


## 13. Make a directory data and move the three files to that instead.

    mkdir data
    cd "a new folder"
    mv ex1.acc ex1.dat orphans.sp ../data/


## 14. Remove test directory.

    cd ..
    rmdir test


## 15. Change directory to data and confirm that you succeded.

    cd data
    ls


## 16. Go back to the home directory or work directory afterwards.

    cd ..


## 17. Make three new directories “newtest” - one inside the other, like a russian doll.

    mkdir -p newtest/newtest/newtest


## 18. Move the data directory to the innermost “newtest” directory.

    cd data
    mv ex1.acc ex1.dat orphans.sp ../newtest/newtest/newtest/


## 19. Confirm that the three files are moved along with the data directory.

    cd ../newtest/newtest/newtest/
    ls


## 20. Copy the three files to your home (your top directory).

    cp {ex1.acc,ex1.dat,orphans.sp} /docs


## 21. Remove all newtest directories and data in the with a single command.

    cd /docs
    rm -rf "a new folder"


## 22. Count the lines in ex1.acc and ex1.dat.

    wc -l ex1.acc ex1.dat


## 23. Concatenate ex1.acc and ex1.dat in the file ex1.tot, 
##i.e. copy the content of two files into one new file. 
##Verify that all gene IDs comes first followed by numerical data.

    cat ex1.acc ex1.dat > ex1.tot


## 24. Merge/Paste ex1.acc and ex1.dat together in ex1.tot, 
##thus destroying the old file. 
##Verify that corresponding gene IDs and numerical data are put on the same line. as the data.

    paste ex1.acc ex1.dat > ex1.tot


## 25. Extract (cut) SwissProt ID and 3rd numerical data (column 1 and 5) from ex1.tot. Put results into a file ex1.res.

    cut -f 1,5 ex1.tot > ex1.res


## 26. Find the 3 SwisProt ID’s in ex1.res which have the largest number(s) in column 2, i.e. the top 3 entries.

    sort -k2 -nr ex1.res | head -3
